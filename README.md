   2. download the .zip
2. Copy the folder into `/usr/local/games/`
3. Move the .desktop to `/usr/share/applications/`
4. Move `snak` (`application/x-shellscript`) into the above folder
## windows (the hard way)
Installation is not as simple for windows.

1. Get yourself a python3.*
2. Download pygame
	1. `pip install pygame`
	2. Go to the dang website
3. Download visual studio 20**
4. Clone the repository
5. Realize `snak`, `Snak.desktop`, and `run.sh` are useless and delete them
6. Run `snak.py`
7. (Optional) Give up and double boot linux
## windows (the easy way)
The easy way?
